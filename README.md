# Recruitment_system

This is a project I developed for the units ICTPRG433 Test Software and ICTPRG440 Apply introductory programming skills in different languages as part of obtaining a Certificate IV in IT (programming specialism) at NMTAFE, WA.

This application is a basic recruitment system where contractors and jobs can be added and removed, contractors can be assigned to jobs, and jobs can be marked as completed, being some of its main functions. The application features a basic GUI based on WPF. The project also includes sample unit testing.

Below are the instructions given:

'Brief
A local recruitment agency has contacted our company to develop an application for their head office to manage and keep track of their contractors. Contractors get added to the systemâ€™s employment pool and can then be assigned to a job. The job is then completed when the contractor lets head office know, and the contractors return to the available employment pool.
Business Requirements
The system should be able to meet the following requirements as determined by the client and stakeholders:
1. Add Contractor.
2. Remove Contractor.
3. Create Job
4. Assign a contractor to a job
5. Complete a job (returning the contractor to the available pool).

To complete some of the above requirements it would be necessary to be able to view and manage the following:
6. View/filter available contractors to add to a job.
7. View/filter jobs that do not have a contractor assigned.

As part of the monthly reporting, managers would like to be able to output the following reports:
8. Search for a job by cost within a given range.'
